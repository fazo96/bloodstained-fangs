The City never sleeps, but it *dreams in nightmares*. Beneath the neon glow and the wail of sirens, *monsters walk among the living*. Vampires hunt in the velvet VIP rooms of exclusive nightclubs. Werewolves prowl the manicured parks under the pale moon. Witches work their forbidden craft in damp basement apartments. They hide in plain sight—your coworker, your neighbor, the stranger on the subway.

Maybe *you're one of them now*. Your old life is ash, scattered by the wind. You've crossed a line you can't uncross. The beast is inside you—the *hunger*, the *power*, the *curse*. You're a predator wearing a human face, and the people you used to be one of? They're prey.

Or maybe you're *still human*. Maybe you saw something you weren't supposed to see. Maybe someone you loved was taken by the shadows. Maybe you hunt the things that go bump in the night. Either way, you're in the *underworld* now. And there's no going back.

*Bloodstained Fangs* is a solo tabletop RPG that drags you kicking and screaming into the urban underworld—a shadow society of supernatural creatures clawing for survival in a modern metropolis. Vampires, werewolves, wizards, and worse have carved out territories, formed fragile alliances, and built empires on *blood and secrets*.

The balance is razor-thin. One wrong move and the whole thing collapses into chaos. You'll navigate the *brutal politics of the night*, face impossible choices, and fight to survive in a world that devours the weak—whether you're struggling to master the beast within or desperately trying to stay human in a city that wants to *bleed you dry*.

  == Introduction

  _Bloodstained Fangs_ follows the following design principles:

  + *Portable*: to play you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
  + *Rules-Light*: the game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
  + *Tag-based*: characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

  With a focus on quick resolutions, *Bloodstained Fangs* throws you headfirst into the heart of the action. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, such as "Nerdy Occult Enthusiast", "Wiccan Acolyte", "High Potential Neonate Vampire", "Hardboiled Vampire Hunter".

  === What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
  A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

  === What is a Solo RPG?

  In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters.
  Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

  Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an *emergent narrative* within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

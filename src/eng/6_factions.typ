  == Factions & Organizations

  The City's underworld is a web of competing organizations—each pulling strings, stepping on throats, and settling scores in the dark. Will you lead one of these factions, or just try to survive the crossfire?

  - *Concept*: Fringe Science Bureau
  - *Skills*: Investigation, Guns

On paper, the Fringe Science Bureau is a federal agency studying anomalies and unexplained phenomena—weird chemicals, strange readings, fringe cases. What most don't know is that buried within the bureaucracy is an Investigations division staffed by disillusioned, hard-bitten detectives who hunt supernatural creatures.

These agents know the truth. They've waded into the underworld and seen things that would shatter a normal person's mind. They're tough, relentless, and hungry to bring down the monsters. But more than anything, they want to prove they're not crazy. They want the world to see what they've seen.

  === The Order
  - *Concept*: Ancient Secret Society
  - *Skills*: Ancient Lore, Subterfuge
  - *Frailty*: Few Members
  - *Gear*: Caine's Stake, All-knowing Orb
  - *Goal*: Preserve World Order
  - *Motive*: Habit
  - *Nemesis*: Knights of the Cross
]

The Order has few members. No one knows where they meet. They are antediluvian Blood Vampires and things that predate names.
They remember Salem. The Crusades. Events that never made it into mortal history books. Some whisper that one of them is Caine himself—the first Blood Vampire, progenitor of all the rest.

Their roots stretch back to prehistory. They don't meddle in the City's petty squabbles unless the established order is threatened—unless mortals are on the verge of learning the truth.

  === The Red Hood
  - *Concept*: Secret Hacker Group
  - *Skills*: Espionage, Hacking
  - *Frailty*: Vampirism (Blood Vampire)
  - *Gear*: Automated Security System, Surveillance Network
  - *Goal*: Secrecy, Financial Independence
  - *Motive*: Fear
  - *Nemesis*: FSB
]

No one's heard of The Red Hood. That's the point. One of the world's most powerful hacking collectives, hidden in plain sight. Their base is somewhere in the City, buried inside a downtown skyscraper crawling with tech startups. Some of those startups are fronts. Behind the server racks and standing desks are nests of Blood Vampires who never see the sun—who live their entire unlives online. They feed on blood bags stolen through corrupt hospital staff and their own black-market blood banks.

They've built a scamming empire that controls the majority of online fraud worldwide. With that expertise and capital, they run a surveillance network that taps into hacked cameras and phones across the City. They monitor everything—tracking threats to their operations and keeping tabs on the people they depend on to stay fed and hidden.

With near-unlimited funds, The Red Hood employs desperate mercenaries for untraceable wet work, ensuring secrecy and severe consequences for failure. Their intel is priceless. Escaping their surveillance? Nearly impossible. Making contact with them? Even harder.

  === The Knights of the Cross
  - *Concept*: Religious Sect
  - *Skills*: Ancient Lore, Faith Magic
  - *Frailty*: Indoctrination
  - *Gear*: Excalibur, The Godstaff
  - *Goal*: Destroy Night Monsters
  - *Motive*: Faith
  - *Nemesis*: Night Monsters
]

Centuries ago, the Knights of the Cross waged holy war on the night, slaughtering thousands of supernatural creatures in purges that burned across Europe. Now, the Knights are few. The underworld is growing. Vampirism festers in the guts of every major city, and technology shields the monsters instead of exposing them. The Vatican still funds the order, funneling resources to fight the Church's ancient enemies.

Deepfakes and AI-generated images have made photographic evidence worthless. Mortals don't believe what they see anymore. It's the perfect breeding ground for monsters, and the Knights are stretched dangerously thin.

The Knights maintain a loose network of independent hunters—mostly vampire killers who don't share the faith but share the hatred. They don't kneel to God, but they'll take the Knights' weapons and intel when it suits them.

  === The Hand
  - *Concept*: United Mob
  - *Skills*: Intimidation, Extortion
  - *Frailty*: Hotheads
  - *Gear*: Machine guns, Blood Money
  - *Goal*: Control Businesses
  - *Motive*: Greed
  - *Nemesis*: District Attorney
]

If you run in the City's nightlife, you'll cross paths with The Hand. They own the strip clubs, the pill-soaked dance floors, the spiked drinks, the high-stakes poker games in basement rooms. They offer vice. They take your money. Sometimes they take your life. You don't need fangs or claws to be a predator.

Some of the bosses know about the supernatural. Others think it's bullshit. Either way, none of them tolerate anything that disrupts business.

  === Wizardry Union
  - *Concept*: Wizardry Organization
  - *Skills*: Magic, Ancient Lore
  - *Frailty*: Inertia
  - *Gear*: Magical Artifacts, Magic Sensing Talismans
  - *Goal*: Develop Magic
  - *Motive*: Power
  - *Nemesis*: Rebel Mages
]

Sometimes a kid's magic awakens spontaneously. When it does, a nearby mage will sense it and offer them a new life in the hidden world. Some of these children grow into centuries-old archmages wielding apocalyptic power. Others never develop their gift. It just fades.

Some awaken with so much raw power they can't control it. They become dangerous. Unstable. That's when the Union shows its teeth. They eliminate the threat. The Union tolerates no risk, and their laws are draconian—medieval, even by medieval standards.

The Union involves itself in underworld affairs to secure powerful artifacts, advance magical research, and occasionally put down rogue monsters who've gone too far. They maintain a sprawling network of contacts: nomadic hunters, minor magical creatures, informants in every shadow.

Not all mages bend the knee. Some reject the Union's bureaucracy, its control, its archaic laws. These rebels live as nomads, always on the run, or hidden so deep the Union can't find them. Sometimes they band together. When those groups get too big, the Union crushes them.

== Characters

In Bloodstained Fangs, you are *vampires, lycanthropes, witches*—creatures clinging to the last shreds of your humanity while living in the shadows. You might be a *neonate vampire* still learning to hunt. A *travelling vampire hunter* with blood on your hands. A *cursed werewolf* fighting the beast within. Perhaps you're a newly initiated member of a Vampire Hunter organization, thrust into a war you barely understand. Or a *secret agent* freshly transferred to the Paranormal Investigations Division, where the cases don't make it into official reports.

Every character bears *the weight of their condition—or their knowledge*. Powerful abilities. Deadly enemies. Some will find power, allies, fragile peace. Others will fall into darkness, lose their humanity, become the very monsters they feared. Even those who hunt the creatures of the night risk becoming what they hunt. *No one is safe from corruption*.

Your journey will be one of *mystery, horror, and blood*, where each step drags you *deeper into the underworld*. Will you claw your way to safety and freedom? Or will your story end in screams and silence?

=== Everything is a Character!

In _Bloodstained Fangs_ Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even relevant objects like vehicles are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- *Name*: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- *Concept*: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like _"Venturous Smuggler"_ or _"Child Prodigy"_.
- *Skills* (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. _"Smart"_ is not a skill, _"Engine Whisperer"_ is.
- *Frailty*: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- *Gear* (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- *Goal*: The long-term objective.
- *Motive*: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- *Nemesis*: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- *Luck*: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These *traits* are described by *tags*, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the *details* of the environment in which the action moves and *conditions* (physical or mental) of the characters are tags.

*They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.*

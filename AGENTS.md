Read README.md to know about the project.

When editing the text content in src:

1. the english version is the master version, so edit that first
2. make sure the italian translation in `src/ita` is updated as well if necessary.

When translating:

- Do not translate people or unique place names
- Try to keep the same text length for pagination issues
- The Hand becomes La Mano
- Wizardry Union becomes Unione della Magia
- Blood Vampire becomes Vampiro del Sangue
- Soul Vampire becomes Vampiro dell'Anima

Avoid translating these terms:

- Fringe Science Division
- Chance (in the context of Chance Die/Dice. Translate it as Dado Chance)

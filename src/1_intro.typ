Bloodstained Fangs is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in a fantasy version of a North American city of the contemporary world, where the night hides creatures such as Vampires, Werewolves and Witches in plain sight among normal human beings. Be a Wizard, a Vampire, a Werewolf and struggle to leave behind your old life as you get pulled into a world wholly different from everything you knew in your previous life and become a predator for the people you were a part of.

This minimalist Solo Role Playing Game is designed to be an exploration of how a loosely organized network of folklore creatures might have adapted to the urban environment, and even thrive, while the precarious balance among the various factions hangs permanently on a thin thread. Struggle to find your place in your new life while battling the beast within you, learn to control your powers and be an agent in a complex web of underworld politics while managing your personal struggles.

== Introduction

_Bloodstained Fangs_ follows the following design principles:

+ *Portable*: to play you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
+ *Rules-Light*: the game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
+ *Tag-based*: characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, *Bloodstained Fangs* throws you headfirst into the heart of the action. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, such as "Nerdy Occult Enthusiast", "Wiccan Acolyte", "High Potential Neonate Vampire", "Hardboiled Vampire Hunter".

=== What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

=== What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters.
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an *emergent narrative* within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

=== Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

=== Minimum Requirements
To play _Bloodstained Fangs_ you will need:
- *4 six sided dice* (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- *Paper and writing tools*: at least a sheet of scrap paper and and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- *Character sheet*: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- *Notebook*: _Bloodstained Fangs_ is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

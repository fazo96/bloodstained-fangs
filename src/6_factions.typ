== Factions & Organizations

The city is packed with underworld organizations pulling each other's strings... and stepping on each other's toes. Will you lead an organization or one of its branches, or be caught in the crossfire of one of the shadow wars?

=== FSB
- *Concept*: Fringe Science Bureau
- *Skills*: Investigation, Guns
- *Frailty*: Bureaucracy, Funding
- *Gear*: Federal Badge, Silenced Pistol
- *Goal*: Expose Underworld
- *Motive*: The World Must Know
- *Nemesis*: The Order

The Fringe Science Bureau is a federal organization made of offices and labs studying weird substances and unexplained phenomena. But few know there is an Investigations division employing disillusioned, hardboiled detectives tasked with chasing and retrieving supernatural creatures.

These guys know what's up: they have dipped their toes into the underworld and have seen things no other mortal would believe. They are tough and determined to take down the monsters, but more than anything they want to prove they are right.

=== The Order
- *Concept*: Ancient Secret Society
- *Skills*: Ancient Lore, Subterfuge
- *Frailty*: Few Members
- *Gear*: Caine's Stake, All-knowing Orb
- *Goal*: Preserve World Order
- *Motive*: Habit
- *Nemesis*: Knights of the Cross

The Order has few members and no one knows where their headquarters is. They are antedeluvian Blood Vampires and other creatures that do not even have a name.
They remember Salem, the crusades, and older events not in any mortal history book. Some say one of them is Caine himself, the first Blood Vampire from which all others descend.

Their roots are in prehistory and they do not get involved into petty affairs of the city, except when the established world order is at stake and widespread mortal knowledge of the supernatural is at risk.

=== The Red Hood
- *Concept*: Secret Hacker Group
- *Skills*: Espionage, Hacking
- *Frailty*: Vampirism (Blood Vampire)
- *Gear*: Automated Security System, Surveillance Network
- *Goal*: Secrecy, Financial Independence
- *Motive*: Fear
- *Nemesis*: FSB

No one has heard of The Red Hood. One of the most powerful but well hidden hacking organizations in the world. Few know its home is in the city, hidden in one of the skyscrapers. Thousands of tech startups work there, but some of them are nests of Blood Vampires living their lives in the internet. They never go out, feeding on blood bags requisitioned through corrupt hospital staff and their own sketchy blood banks.

They have built a scamming empire online that controls the vast majority of scam operations. With the expertise and funds, they run a surveillance network leveraging hacked security cameras and phones to collect information about most dealings of the regular world and the underworld, especially monitoring for risky situations that could compromise their safety and the details of the life of the people they depend on for their business.

Their information can be priceless, but escaping their surveillance is almost impossible. Getting a hold of them: even harder.

=== The Knights of the Cross
- *Concept*: Religious Sect
- *Skills*: Ancient Lore, Faith Magic
- *Frailty*: Indoctrination
- *Gear*: Excalibur, The Godstaff
- *Goal*: Destroy Night Monsters
- *Motive*: Faith
- *Nemesis*: Night Monsters

Hundreds of years ago, the Knights of the Cross held successful persecutions killing thousands of night creatures. These days, the knights are few, but the underworld is growing. Vampirism festers in the underbelly of the cities, technology aiding them in hiding instead of exposing them. The Vatican funds this group and provides them with resources to fight the supernatural enemies of the Church.

Fake news and AI generated images causes mortals to no longer believe in photographic evidence. These are all ideal conditions for the proliferation of monsters, and the Knights are spread thin.

The Knights also maintain a loose communication networks coordinating independent monster hunters of various kinds, mainly Vampire Hunters. These people do not believe in the Almighty but they share the hate for the monsters of the night and sometimes benefit from the resources of the Knights of the Cross.

=== The Hand
- *Concept*: United Mob
- *Skills*: Intimidation, Extortion
- *Frailty*: Hotheads
- *Gear*: Machine guns, Blood Money
- *Goal*: Control Businesses
- *Motive*: Greed
- *Nemesis*: Night Monsters

If you are a dweller of the night life, it is hard not to run into The Hand. The Hand offers: strip clubs, drug-ridden dance floors, spiked cocktails, stacks of cash on underground poker tables, and worse things. The Hand also takes: mainly your money, sometimes your life. It does not take supernatural powers to become a monster that prowls the night.

Some of the bosses are aware of the creatures of the night, but others do not believe it. Anyway, none of them will tolerate disruption to their business.

=== Wizardry Union
- *Concept*: Wizardry Organization
- *Skills*: Magic, Ancient Lore
- *Frailty*: Inertia
- *Gear*: Magical Artifacts, Magic Sensing Talismans
- *Goal*: Develop Magic
- *Motive*: Power
- *Nemesis*: Rebel Mages

Kids sometimes develop magical power spontaneously. When that happens, a mage nearby will sense it and offer the kid a new life in the magical world. Some grow to become centuries old archmages with earth shattering power. Others never develop their power which fizzle out.

Some will have so much raw power that they are unable to control it, and turn dangerous and crazy. Here the Union shows their dark side in disposing of the danger. No risk is tolerated in the Union, and their law can sometimes be old fashioned: even by middle ages standard.

The Union gets involved in the regular affairs of the underworld in order to secure powerful artifacts, develop and study more powerful magic, and occasionally put a stop to unhinged activities of dangerous monsters. They have a widespread social network encompassing nomadic vampire hunters and harmless magical creatures of various kinds.

Some wizards and witches reject the Union, its bureaucracy, control and old-fashioned laws. These rebels typically live on their own as nomads, on the run from the Union, or well hidden. Sometimes they organize into small groups but the bigger ones get crushed by the mighty power of the Union.

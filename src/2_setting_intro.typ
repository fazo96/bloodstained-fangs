  == Setting Introduction

  You've heard the stories: Vampires. Lycanthropes. Witches. They're not folklore—they're real. They've always been real. They're everywhere. Standing behind you in line at the 24/7 corner store at 3 AM. Driving the trucks that deliver your food. Maintaining the networks that run your life.

  The underworld is a web of rival organizations, each claiming dominion over their own kind. These factions wage endless shadow wars—over the treatment of mortals, over ancient grudges, over territory soaked in blood. Hatred runs deep between the breeds. Trust is a luxury no one can afford.

  === Timeline

  It is the year 2025. Smartphones with AI assistants are ubiquitous, and photographic evidence means nothing in a world drowning in deepfakes and synthetic media. After a brief decade of fear over cellphone cameras, the creatures of the night have grown bold again—expanding their hunting grounds with impunity.

  Rampant disinformation and weaponized fake news make any attempt to expose them futile. The growing chasm between mortals who prowl questionable city districts for late-night thrills and those who cling to daylight safety means the prey are more isolated than ever. More vulnerable. Easier to pick off.

  A police department drowning in missing persons cases, homicides, and assault reports can barely keep the lights on, let alone solve crimes. The guilty walk free. The predators grow bolder every night. And the bodies keep piling up.

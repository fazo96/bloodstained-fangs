== Adventure Tables

Every city bleeds its own stories. Roll on the table below when you need a hook sharp enough to draw blood—something to drag your players into the dark. These seeds are starting points, not scripts. Twist them. Make them yours. Let them fester.

    [They dredged up a sarcophagus from the harbor—stone older than the City itself. The university's taking delivery tonight. Blood vampires are crawling out of the woodwork, desperate to stop it. What's sealed inside? And why does it scare things that don't scare easy?],
    [The full moon bleeds red tonight. Howls echo through the streets—not wolf howls, something older. Robed figures gather in the alleys, chanting in a language that makes your teeth ache. The werewolves are locked inside, terrified. What ritual is this? And what happens when it's complete?],
    [FSB raided a Red Hood nest—top floor of a waterfront warehouse. When they kicked the door in, the place was gutted. Empty. Blood still wet on the walls. One agent won't let it go. She's asking questions. Dangerous questions. What did the vampires leave behind? And why is she so sure they're coming back?],
    [The Hand's got a mole in the precinct. Now their cover's blown and they're at your door, bleeding and desperate. They don't know what you really are. Why do they trust you? And what secret are you keeping that could get you both killed?],
    [You're leading a coven of renegade witches, running for your lives. The City's your last refuge—a place to disappear into the cracks. Who's hunting you? What did you do to earn a death sentence? And how long before they find you here?],
    [The mayor's corpse is slumped over his desk, neck torn open, blood pooled on imported mahogany. Fang marks. No question what did this. Someone's already working to bury the story—scrubbing the scene, buying silence. Who's covering it up? And are you helping them, or burning it all down?],
    [Your brother drags you from motel to motel, chasing work he won't explain. "Hunting," he says. You patch him up when he stumbles back days later, bleeding, half-dead. Then he leaves again. It's been a month this time. No calls. No texts. You can't go to the cops. Why not? What do you find when you search his things? And why did he have to take you along?],
    [You're drunk, stumbling through alleys with your crew. You find your buddy pressed against a dumpster, some girl on top of him. Except she's not kissing him—she's feeding. Fangs deep in his throat. Blood everywhere. He's still twitching. What do you do?],
    [Tonight's the night. The pack's finally letting you in. You've waited years for this—to know what happens under the full moon, to understand what your family really is. The ritual's starting. The moon's rising. And you're about to find out if you're strong enough to survive it.],
    [You work the night shift at the morgue. Quiet. Cold. Then you hear metal scraping—a drawer sliding open. One of the corpses sits up, swings its legs over the edge, and points a gun at your chest. "I need your help," it says. What the hell is it? And what does it want badly enough to crawl out of a body bag?],
    [You run a back-alley clinic. Cash only. No questions. Tonight you're prepping the usual order—blood bags, refrigerated, ready for pickup. You open the door expecting the regular contact. Instead, there's a man in a suit. FSB badge. He starts asking questions. What do you tell him?],
    [Your friend's been obsessed with this girl. Talks about her constantly. Won't shut up. But he looks like shit—hollow-eyed, pale, like she's draining him dry. He's about to lose his job. His apartment's a wreck. What finally makes you confront him? And do you know what kind of vampire has its hooks in him—or are you about to find out the hard way?],
    [You go to church like you always do. Father Martin's not at the altar. You find him in the back room with a man holding an assault rifle and a sword—an actual medieval longsword. They need your help hunting something. They say they have no choice but to ask you. What are they hunting? And why you?],
    [You're doing time when the lights cut out. Screaming. Gunfire. Something tears through the cell block like a wrecking ball, heading straight for one prisoner. You see it happen—something no rational person would believe. Who's the prisoner? What broke them out? And what's your play?],
    [The doctors give you weeks. Maybe days. It happened so fast. You're saying goodbye to someone you love when you black out. You wake in darkness, throat burning with a thirst so fierce it's agony. They're there with you. "You won't die," they whisper. But you're not alive anymore either. Why did they turn you? And how do you live with what you've become?],
    [You've been hunting it for months. Years, maybe. Now you've finally tracked it to the City. But you're running out of time. If you don't catch it soon, something catastrophic happens. What is it? What's the clock ticking down to? And what happens if you fail?],
    [Your magic woke up wrong. Someone you love is in the hospital—or worse. A witch saw what you did. They pull you aside, warn you about the Wizardry Union. "They'll find you," they say. "Let me help you disappear." Do you trust them? And what did your power do?],
    [You're FSB. Your partner pulls you into a stairwell, whispers something about a mole inside the Bureau. Then they vanish. No calls. No trace. What did they tell you? And what are you going to do about it?],
    [You're a Union wizard sent to mentor a kid whose power just surfaced. Now you're on a rooftop at 3 AM, trying to talk them off the ledge. Literally. They want to jump. Why? What did their magic do to them? And can you say anything that'll make them step back?],
    [Someone called you about a haunting. You show up. The people who called you are dead. Fresh. Still warm. The ghost is still here. And it knows you're coming.],
    [You're dancing, high as hell, lost in the music and the heat of someone's body against yours. You don't remember taking anything. The bass drops. Time slows. You catch a glint of silver in their eyes—their skin shimmering, too perfect. You fall into them. Hours later, you wake up in a strange bed. They're next to you. Dead. Knife in their heart. Someone's pulling it out, telling you to stay calm. What the fuck happened? And who's holding the knife?],
    [High-profile targets are dying. Politicians. CEOs. Their bodies explode from the inside, leaving nothing but gore and a single intact heart on the floor. Still beating. Until someone looks at it. Then it stops. You're the one they call for this kind of thing. What are you walking into?],
    [You watched your partner get torn apart by a vampire. You told the captain. He thinks you're losing it, wants you on psych leave. You know what you saw. You've got a lead. So you throw your badge and gun on his desk and walk. Outside, someone's waiting. They offer to help. Who are they? And what do they want in return?],
    [Rumor says there's a witch who can make monsters mortal again. Cure vampirism. Lift the wolf's curse. Turn back the clock. How did you hear about it? And why are you desperate enough to believe it?],
    [The National Guard's locked down the City. Checkpoints. Curfew. No one in or out. Choppers overhead. They're not saying why. Were you already inside when it happened? Or were you sent in to deal with whatever's loose?],
    [An explosion in the sewers brought down half a city block. The cops are suiting up to go in. You know what's down there. Or you think you do. What are they about to find? And why does it terrify you?],
    [Your master sent you to retrieve an ancient artifact. It's here, in the City, in someone's hands. Who has it? How are you going to take it from them? And what happens if you fail?],
    [People are flocking to the cathedral. They say the Virgin Mary appeared in the nave, weeping blood. You know better. It's a specter—and a dangerous one. What does it want? And how do you stop it before someone gets killed?],
    [Unconnected people—different ages, backgrounds, lives—are walking into the same warehouse and ending it. Hanging. Overdose. Bullet. The cops think it's a suicide cult. You know it's something worse. What's compelling them? How are they linked? And why do you care?],
    [Locusts swarm the streets, blotting out the sky. People are screaming about the apocalypse. But this isn't the end of the world. It's a warning. An omen. Something's coming. What? How do you know? And what can you do to stop it?],
    [The public library burned to the ground. Except for one section—untouched, pristine, surrounded by ash. Someone's going there. Someone else is trying to stop them. Where do you stand? And what's in that section worth killing for?],
    [They're calling it the Second Coming. The Knights of the Cross know better. It's not Christ. What is it? What does it want? And how do you stop it?],
    [You came to the City to return a relic to its resting place. You were ambushed the moment you arrived. Left bleeding in an alley, the relic gone. Who knew you were coming? And how are you going to finish the job?],
    [They trusted you to protect someone very important, but you got distracted for a second and they are gone. Who where they? Why did they need protection? And how do you find them?],
    [The sun sets. The moon rises red. The entire sky bleeds crimson: The Blood Moon. How does it warp the City? What does it do to you?],
    [A woman finds you. Desperate. Shaking. Her husband—missing for two weeks. The cops won't help. Why does she come to you? And what makes you say yes?],

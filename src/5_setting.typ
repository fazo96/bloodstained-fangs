== Setting Information

The world of Bloodstained Fangs is full of stories. They are smaller stories, sometimes bigger stories, but they always take place in the shadows, at night. Behind a dark corner in an alley, in a dimly lit basement, in the corners of a strip club, between the tables at the very end of the diner, or in someone's trashed and messy apartment.

=== The City

The City is somewhere in North America, on the coast. It's large, messy and dangerous. Sirens can be heard at almost all times in the night. Newspaper pages float in the misty wind. Fog and smoke glimmer in the light of the street lamps. It never sleeps, with its neon signs lighting the sky and hiding the stars under a coat of dark clouds. Pawn shops hide supernatural artifacts, and regular deadly guns. Bars and diners are the hang out spot of all kinds of night predators.

There are many districts in the city:

- *The Docks*: mobsters from The Hand handling shipment of who knows what going in an out in containers in the middle of the night.
- *The Beach*: beach parties, late night cocktails served on the sand, music and drugs. The perfect environment for Soul Vampires.
- *Downtown*: fancy, elite, expensive. Efficient police service with private guards. The juiciest targets for an heist, or for premium blood dolls. Tall skyscrapers project the will of their masters onto the common people from high above.
- *Slum*: where people get mugged, and where the drugs are cut with the worst stuff. Shady bars with red lights. Unhinged night monsters prowl the alleys looking for hobos and drunks for a quick meal.
- *Oldtown*: the heart of the Hand. The uninvited at night are closely guarded. Dangerous hunting territory for monsters. Casinos and backalley gambling tables.
- *Misty Park Forest*: a natural reservation handled by forest guards that are very in tune with nature. Home to wolves. Just regular wolves?
- *Riverside*: people coming and going from the train station. The artery bringing cars and trucks in the city. Well patrolled and well lit at night. The underworld passes through but does not linger.

Important points of interest of the city are:

- The Cathedral: local hideout of the Knights of the Cross, other than being a safe haven for travellers of all kinds. Father Martin is a true man of faith, denying help to no one.
- Jimmy's: pawn shop under a bridge in Oldtown. Under the counter, Jimmy stocks various kinds of weapons that might help hunt... bigger game.
- Shatter: the coolest night club Downtown. You need to be on the list to get in. Inside, a safe haven for vampires of all kinds, with blood dolls littering the place.
- Alder Medical Inc.: many vampires know that in the back alley, you can knock on the basement door and a guy will sell you blood bags. They will cost a lot.
- Big House: a huge wooden mansion in the Misty Park Forest and the hideout of the local werewolves protecting the forest. Other punks and outcasts live here, usually hiding from someone... or something.
- Police HQ: downtown, the police have their main HQ where the most hardcore detectives are put on the hardest cases. Some crack, going rogue, or getting lost in the underworld.
- La Bella Vista: historic restaurant with a great view. Great food and service, with the right amount of fancy. On the back, illegal high stakes poker tables are frequently visited by high ranking bosses of The Hand.
- The Public Library: a very old library with ancient tomes hidden deep. The librarian runs an occult group.

=== Supernatural Entities
The city is home to wandering and organized groups of all kinds of supernatural beings:

- *Blood Vampires*, feeding by sucking the blood out of their victim's neck. They can't stand the sun, and hide in nests during the day. Some are centuries old, mastering the blood magic from their inner beast and charming mortals to their will. Others are newborn, reckless, dangerous and so very very thirsty. Their body is effectively dead: no heartbeat, pale skin, dead eyes. It's not easy to notice at night, in the dark, unless you look closely. And even then, to the untrained eye they might just look sickly. They are supernaturally strong: and they get stronger as they ages, just like the body becomes less and less human. Some vampires have roamed the earth for millennia, but they are rare, even legends. Some say they look so monstrous that mortals will faint at first sight. When a blood vampire feeds, the victim is injected with a strong narcotic similar to heroin. The wounds on their neck close quickly and the victim is in a state of daze: they won't remember much, but they will be looking for more. Often they become blood dolls: servants to their vampire master, doing anything they ask to get another hit.
- *Ghouls* are created when a vampire makes a mortal drink their blood. They inherit some of the supernatural abilities of the vampire, for a time, as long as they regularly drink their blood. They are often loyal servants of their vampire master.
- *Soul Vampires*, dominating the dance floor, smooth talking at the bar counter, and surrounded by admirers, unwillingly feeding their souls to the beast. Whenever they stand, they are the center of the room, the life of the party. Some wander, trying to not feed on the same people too long so they don't start losing memories and going insane. Other revel in the attention and become politicians, cult leaders, celebrities, quickly gathering a large following: until they are found, forced to hide or worse. Their life is one of suffering and loneliness, their curse making anyone close to them go insane. They don't fear the sunlight, and they have magic in their blood: some say if you have a strong sense for magic, you can see their skin sparkle when exposed to direct sunlight. Their condition is hereditary, but they live for centuries: the family is large, but pure blooded soul vampires are rare, and extremely dangerous. The ancient, pure blooded ones control the entertainment industry throughout the world from the shadows.
- *Werewolves* are a species similar to humans, with magical elements in their body allowing them to be in tune with nature and transform into large wolves. Mature werewolves are able to remember and even control their behavior when transformed by the energy of the full moon, but young ones are reckless, mindless beasts of the night. Full blooded Werewolves are able to spontaneously turn into wolves even without the full moon. For most of them though, they have only some Werewolf blood in them and need a ritual beneath the full moon in order to turn.
- *Wizards and Witches* are humans that inherited a magical affinity from their parents. This affinity can emerge as spontaneous magical abilities with varying type and strength. With training and mentorship, it can be developed into true, sometimes earth shattering power. But it is not without risk: magic can bend and shape the body, mind and soul of those who wield it.
- *Faith* can be deadly against supernatural and magical beings. True faith, inbued into artifacts and wielded by the faithful, is an extremely powerful form of magic.
- *Artifacts*: it's not just creatures that hold supernatural power in this world. Artifacts can do that as well, by being inbued with the Faith of mortals or by being shaped by the expert hands of powerful mages. Some of these items are in the hands of various organizations of the underworld, but some remain hidden. Until someone unearths them.

=== Mortals

Mortal is the term used in the underworld to refer to humans that have no magical or supernatural abilities. They are the regular people, they live in the background of stories in this world. Except when a loved one goes missing. Or when a thirsty Vampire is in the right place at the right time. Or when something big happens in the middle of the street, the sirens are racing in, the horrified screams of the witnesses fill the damp air. Somewhere, a phone dings. The FSB agent picks it up, and gets moving.

Either way, most people will deny the supernatural even when presented with evidence. They will say it's fabricated, they will point out AI generated pictures. When cellphones with cameras became popular, the underworld reeled, but now photographic evidence is not a big deal anymore.

=== Money and Jobs

There is lots of work to do in the night: security guards, transport escorts, bar tending, prostitution, assassination. Mortals in contact of the underworld will often begin by doing one of these jobs, which are also often held by creatures of the night that are able to maintain human appearance and behaviors.

Nightlife lovers and tourists bring the money in, which then flows
=== Magic

There are many forms and schools of magic, but most of them are studied and developed by the Wizardry Union. Magic is innate, and requires predisposition for being used. But some are late bloomers: magical awakening can happen at any age and at varying levels. Magic affinity can be developed (assuming it is not totally absent) but people starting with the strongest awakening have the highest potential, both for greatness and for peril.

No magic is free to use, there is always a cost to pay: most commonly energy is drawn from one's soul or the surroundings, artifacts of power, or natural sources such as the Moon, Fire, Water, Earth, Wind. Dark and dangerous forms of magic such as Blood Magic can have serious consequences to their users, shaping them as much as they shape the magic.
=== Folklore and Mythology

Everyone knows monsters aren't real. Those videos on the internet? Fake, CGI, AI generated. The vampire forums online? Roleplay. The rituals on those books? Fiction. That unexplained phenomena? Just something science cannot explain yet, or some trick or illusion.

The initiated will know that monsters and magic are real, but it is very difficult to turn a "normal" mortal into a believer: think about yourself, would you believe this stuff is real? What would it take for you to believe?

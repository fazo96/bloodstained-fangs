== Setting Introduction

You have heard of them: Vampires, Lycantropes, Witches... they are not folklore. They exist, they always have. They are everywhere, in line at the 24/7 corner store in the middle of the night, driving your trucks, maintaining your computer networks.

The underworld is made up of various organizations that each kind of creature of the night is a part of. These organizations are often in conflict due to disagreements on the treatment of "mortals" or due to disgust and hate between each other.

=== Playable Themes

- *Personal struggle in adapting to a new reality* as your body, mind and physiology are forever changed
- *Conflict between different groups for control over the city* as you get thrown into the politics of warring factions across different night creatures all competing for control on territory and striving to keep their existence a secret from those who hunt them
- *Being torn between the human life and the new unlife*, struggling to keep old relationships working, facing your own publicly declared death, and trying to protect your loved ones from what you've become
- *Rebelling against the status quo* of the organizations controlling life in the underworld
- *Research into the mysteries* of the nature of Vampires, Lycantropes, and others as you try to find a cure for your condition.
- *Protecting the people of the city* from the monsters of the night, or becoming one of them and face persecution by those protecting mortals

=== Timeline

It is the year 2025. Smartphones with AI access are common, and photographic evidence of the supernatural matters nothing in a world with generative AI. After a brief decade scared about cellphones with cameras, creatures of the night feel more confident than ever in expanding their activities.

Rampant disinformation and fake news make any effort to expose them much harder than it has to be, and the growing divide between mortals that venture into questionable city districts to have late night fun and people living their life safely during the day means that preys are more isolated than ever.

An police department overworked and overloaded with missing person cases, homicide, assault reports cannot deal with any of them effectively and the criminals are going unpunished while the monster grow more confident every night.

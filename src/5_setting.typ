  == Setting Information

  The world of Bloodstained Fangs is built on stories—small, intimate tales and sprawling conspiracies alike—but they all unfold in the shadows, after dark. In back alleys where streetlights flicker and die. In basement rooms thick with cigarette smoke. In the shadowed corners of strip clubs, the back booths of all-night diners, or the wreckage of someone's forgotten apartment.

  === The City

  The City sprawls somewhere along the North American coast—vast, filthy, and lethal. Sirens wail through the night like wounded animals. Newspaper pages tumble through mist-choked streets. Fog and smoke catch the sickly glow of street lamps, painting everything in shades of amber and ash. The City never sleeps. Neon signs bleed color into the sky, drowning the stars beneath a shroud of smog and storm clouds. Pawn shops deal in cursed relics and cold steel. Bars and diners serve as hunting grounds for things that wear human faces.

  === Districts

  1. *The Docks*: The Hand's muscle moves shipments through rusted containers in the dead of night. Don't ask what's inside.
  2. *The Beach*: Bonfires and bass lines. Late-night cocktails served on black sand. Music, pills, and willing prey. Soul Vampires thrive here.
  3. *Downtown*: Glass towers and old money. Private security and cops who actually show up. The richest hunting grounds—whether you're after blood dolls or vault codes. Skyscrapers loom like tombstones, casting long shadows over the streets below.
  4. *Slum*: Where junkies get rolled and dealers cut their product with rat poison. Dive bars glow red through grimy windows, casinos with velvet ropes and back-alley card games where the stakes are higher than money. Feral things stalk the alleys, looking for easy meals—drunks, vagrants, anyone who won't be missed.
  5. *Misty Park Forest*: A nature preserve patrolled by rangers who know the woods too well. Home to wolves. Just wolves. Probably.
  6. *Riverside*: The City's main artery. Trains disgorge commuters and cargo around the clock. Well-lit, well-patrolled. The underworld flows through but never lingers.

  === Important Points of Interest

  - *The Cathedral*: Sanctuary for the Knights of the Cross and anyone desperate enough to seek shelter. Father Martin turns no one away. His faith is the real deal.
  - *Jimmy's*: A pawn shop wedged under a bridge in the Slum. Jimmy keeps the good stuff under the counter—weapons for hunting things that don't die easy.
  - *Shatter*: Downtown's most exclusive nightclub. If you're not on the list, you're not getting in. Inside, vampires of every stripe mingle freely. Blood dolls draped over velvet couches, necks already bruised.
  - *Alder Medical Inc.*: Knock on the basement door in the back alley. A guy in scrubs will sell you blood bags, no questions asked. Bring cash. Lots of it.
  - *Big House*: A sprawling wooden mansion deep in Misty Park Forest. Werewolf territory. Also home to runaways, outcasts, and anyone hiding from something worse than the law.
  - *Police HQ*: Downtown. Where the City's hardest detectives work the cases that break minds. Some crack under the pressure. Some go rogue. Some disappear into the same darkness they were hunting.
  - *La Bella Vista*: Historic restaurant with a killer view and impeccable service. In the back room, The Hand's upper echelon plays high-stakes poker with money that's never seen a bank.
  - *The Public Library*: Ancient stone and older secrets. Rare tomes hidden in the restricted section. The head librarian runs an occult study group on Thursday nights.

  === Supernatural Entities
  The City crawls with supernatural predators—some lone hunters, others bound by ancient hierarchies:

  - *Blood Vampires*: The classic nightmare. They feed on blood, draining it from puncture wounds in the neck. Sunlight burns them to ash, so they nest in darkness during the day. The old ones have walked the earth for centuries, wielding blood magic and bending mortal minds like clay. The young ones are feral—reckless, ravenous, and stupid with hunger. All of them are corpses wearing human skin: no pulse, pallid flesh, eyes like dirty glass. Hard to spot in the dark unless you know what to look for. Even then, they might just look strung out. They're supernaturally strong, and they only get stronger—and less human—with age. The eldest are living myths, so warped by time that mortals collapse at the sight of them. When a blood vampire feeds, it injects venom into the wound—a narcotic rush stronger than heroin. The punctures seal fast. The victim remembers nothing but the high, and they'll do anything to feel it again. That's how you get blood dolls: addicts who'll crawl through broken glass for another bite.
]

- *Ghouls*: What happens when a vampire makes a mortal drink their blood. Ghouls gain a shadow of their master's power—strength, speed, resilience—but only as long as they keep drinking. Most are fanatically loyal. Some are just desperate.
- *Soul Vampires*: They own every room they enter. Charismatic, magnetic, impossible to ignore. They feed on souls without meaning to, draining the life from everyone around them. Some try to stay on the move, never feeding from the same crowd long enough to leave them hollow. Others embrace it—becoming celebrities, politicians, cult leaders—surrounded by devotees who slowly lose their minds. It's a curse of isolation. Everyone they love goes mad. They don't fear the sun. Magic runs in their veins; some say their skin glimmers in direct sunlight if you have the sight to see it. The condition is hereditary, and they live for centuries. Purebloods are rare and terrifyingly powerful. The oldest bloodlines pull the strings of the global entertainment industry from the shadows.
- *Werewolves*: A species parallel to humanity, touched by primal magic. They're in tune with nature and can transform into massive wolves. Mature werewolves retain their minds when the full moon calls, even control the change. Young ones lose themselves completely—mindless, savage, unstoppable. Purebloods can shift at will. Most have only a trace of wolf blood and need a ritual under the full moon to transform.
- *Wizards and Witches*: Humans born with magic in their blood, inherited from their parents. It manifests differently in everyone—some get parlor tricks, others get apocalyptic power. Training can sharpen the gift, but magic is a double-edged blade. It warps the body, twists the mind, scars the soul.
- *Faith*: True faith is a weapon. Blessed relics in the hands of true believers can burn through supernatural flesh like acid. It's one of the purest—and deadliest—forms of magic.
- *Artifacts*: Power doesn't just live in flesh and bone. Objects can hold it too—sanctified by faith or forged by arcane hands. Some are locked away in vaults. Others are buried, waiting for someone foolish enough to dig them up.

  === Mortals

  Mortal. That's what the underworld calls humans without magic or supernatural blood. They're the background noise—until they're not. Until someone they love vanishes. Until a hungry vampire catches them in the wrong alley at the wrong time. Until something impossible happens in broad daylight, sirens screaming, witnesses shrieking into the wet night air. Somewhere across town, a phone buzzes. An FSB agent reads the message and starts moving.

  Most people deny the supernatural even when it's staring them in the face. They'll call it fake, CGI, deepfakes. When camera phones first appeared, the underworld panicked. Now? Photographic evidence means nothing. Everyone assumes it's doctored.

  === Money and Jobs

  The night economy is vast: security work, armed escorts, bartending, sex work, contract killing. Mortals who brush against the underworld usually start with one of these gigs. So do the creatures who can pass for human.

  === Magic

  Magic takes many forms, but most traditions are studied and codified by the Wizardry Union. Magic is innate—you're born with it or you're not. Some awaken early. Others bloom late, their power surfacing at any age and in wildly different strengths. Affinity can be trained and honed, but those who start strong have the highest ceiling—for glory and for ruin.

  Magic always has a price. Energy is drawn from the caster's soul, the environment, enchanted artifacts, or natural forces—the Moon, Fire, Water, Earth, Wind. Darker arts like Blood Magic exact a heavier toll, warping the practitioner as much as the spell itself.

  === Folklore and Mythology

  Everyone knows monsters aren't real. Those videos online? Fake. CGI. Deepfakes. The vampire forums? Roleplay. The rituals in those old books? Fiction. Unexplained phenomena? Just gaps in our understanding. Parlor tricks and mass hysteria.

  The initiated know better. Monsters and magic are real. But convincing a "normal" mortal? Nearly impossible. Ask yourself: would you believe it? What would it take to make you believe?

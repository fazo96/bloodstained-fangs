  == Setting Introduction

  You've heard the stories whispered in the dark: Vampires. Lycanthropes. Witches. They're not just folklore—they're *real*. They've always been real. And they're *everywhere*. Standing behind you in line at the 24/7 corner store at 3 AM, eyes a little too reflective. Driving the trucks that deliver your food. Maintaining the invisible networks that run your life.

  The underworld is a tangled web of *rival organizations*, each claiming dominion over their own kind. These factions wage *endless shadow wars*—over the right to feed on mortals, over ancient grudges that span centuries, over territory soaked in fresh blood. Hatred runs deep between the breeds. In this city, *trust is a luxury* no one can afford.

  === Playable Themes

  - *Personal struggle* as your body, mind, and physiology are twisted beyond recognition by the curse.
  - *Brutal faction politics* as you're dragged into the wars of night creatures vying for territory, power, and survival while keeping their existence hidden.
  - *The duality of existence*, torn between your fading human life and the new unlife, desperately trying to shield your loved ones from the monster you've become.
  - *Rebellion against the ancients*, fighting the suffocating control of organizations that have ruled the underworld for millennia.
  - *Uncovering forbidden lore*, searching desperately for a cure or a way to break the curse before it consumes you entirely.
  - *The vigilante's path*, protecting the innocent from the predators of the night, even as you become one of them and face persecution from both sides.

  === Timeline

  It is the year *2025*. Smartphones with AI assistants are ubiquitous, and photographic evidence means nothing in a world drowning in *deepfakes and synthetic media*. After a brief decade of fear over cellphone cameras, the creatures of the night have grown bold again. They hide in the noise, expanding their hunting grounds with *impunity*.

  *Rampant disinformation* and weaponized fake news make any attempt to expose them futile. If you post a video of a werewolf transformation, the comments will call it CGI before the first view count ticks over. The growing chasm between mortals who prowl questionable city districts for late-night thrills and those who cling to daylight safety means the prey are more isolated than ever. More vulnerable. *Easier to pick off*.

  A police department drowning in missing persons cases, homicides, and assault reports can barely keep the lights on, let alone solve crimes. The *guilty walk free*. The predators grow bolder every night. And the bodies keep piling up in the morgue, labeled "John Doe" and forgotten.
